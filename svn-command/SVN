git is the best version control. Before it was sub-version? 
advantage of git over other version control system is:
Decentralized database, one can have a copy of the repo both locally and remote. 
Ease of fetching a back up if the one of the local repo crashes or fails to load
Mercurial is free but the best for private repositories, github is more for open-source projects where people can be able to contribute to the source code
